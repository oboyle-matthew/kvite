<u>Final Project Topic</u><br><br>
We would like to create a web application that helps Duke students organize their tenting schedules on a platform that also functions as a social network. Since a third of the Duke population participates in any form of tenting, our app (<b>K-vite<b>) would appeal to many students who struggle to organize shifts for their tenting groups.<br><br>
The main function of our app is viewing calendars. We will have three calendars that are accessible based on different user roles. A guest (i.e., any student) will have read-only access to a <i>global</i> calendar that lists general sporting events and displays all tenting shifts. A user (i.e., anyone who participates in tenting) would also have read-only access to the <i>global</i> calendar, but have read-write permissions on their <i>individual</i> calendar that they use for noting available times for scheduling, as well as the <i>team</i> calendar that includes specific details about the schedule of the user’s tenting group. Admins (i.e., line monitors) have read-write permissions for all calendars. Filters will allow guests, users, and admins to view specific events of each calendar. Another feature that we would like to include is push notifications to notify people of their tenting shift(s), a grace period (dependent on if there is another basketball game during the season and/or severe weather conditions), and instances where a tenting shift is dropped and needs picking up.<br><br>
Although we’ll only be using a few users to test our scheduling algorithm and functionality of our application, we think that this could eventually expand to a university scale that will help both Duke Athletics and Duke students have a more effective and efficient tenting process for the basketball season.
